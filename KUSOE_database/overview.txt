## If You Pass the Entrance Exam (Appear on the Merit List)
- **Counseling:** Shortlisted candidates are called for a counseling session based on their merit rank. The counseling schedule is published on the KU website.
- **Program Selection:** During counseling, candidates choose their preferred engineering discipline based on their merit rank and the availability of seats in that program. Higher-ranked candidates get the first choice.
- **Admission Offer:** Successful candidates receive an offer of admission.
- **Admission Confirmation:** To confirm the admission, candidates must submit their original academic documents for verification and pay the required admission and first-semester fees within the specified deadline.

## If You Fail the Entrance Exam (Do Not Appear on the Merit List)
- Candidates who do not score high enough to be on the merit list are not eligible for admission in that academic year.
- There is no provision for re-evaluation of the CBT test.
- Such candidates can apply again in the following year's admission cycle.
