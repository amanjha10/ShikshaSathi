    "This notebook demonstrates a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to query information about Kathmandu University School of Engineering (KUSOE).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components:\n",
    "- **Data Source**: A custom-built database of text files located in `../KUSOE_database/`.\n",
    "- **Chunking**: Files are split into smaller chunks using a custom delimiter (`-c-h-u-n-k-h-e-r-e-`).\n",
    "- **Embeddings**: `bge-small-en` model is used to generate embeddings for the chunks.\n",
    "- **Vector Store**: `ChromaDB` (in-memory) is used to store the embeddings and perform similarity searches.\n",
    "- **Framework**: `LlamaIndex` orchestrates the pipeline from data loading to querying.\n",
